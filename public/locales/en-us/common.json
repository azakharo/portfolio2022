The town is a restricted area. You can't visit it without special permission. In 1949 the first Soviet atomic bomb was created in my town. Also Sarov is known as a religion center. In Russia many people know about Serafim Sarovskiy and Diveevo. Sarov is a compact pleasant town surrounded by forests. I love Sarov!",
