  "about__whatIhaveLearned__text": "I started my web development with Python and Django in 2011.<br />In 2014 I started to create SPA apps with the help of <strong>AngularJS</strong>. I had used it for about 3 years.<br />In 2017 I switched to <strong>React</strong> for SPA development. I implemented several successful projects with React (see the examples below). I was lucky – each project I started from scratch, I played a very active part in the development and promoted the application to production. I have tried different UI kits, state managers, many libraries and tools. I have set up the linting, type-checking, transpiling and automated testing.<br />In 2023 I started to use <strong>SSR</strong> (Next.js) and got familiar with TurboRepo.",
  "about__whatIhaveLearned__title": "What I have already tried in the frontend development",
  "about__whatIwantToLearn__text": "* <strong>SSR</strong> - I'd like to continue with SSR. Of course, only if it's suitable for the application I will develop.<br />* <strong>Micro-frontends</strong> - it would be interesting to build a big app based on micro-frontends or re-factor existing legacy app by converting its routes into micro-frontends step-by-step, one after another.<br />* <strong>StoryBook</strong> - I'd like to develop own UI Kit-а and document it with the help of StoryBook.<br />* <strong>Monorepo</strong> – it could be very useful in some cases. For example, when you develop both a frontend and a backend it's very convenient to place them in one repository. Or when your team develops micro-frontends which have big shared code.<br />* <strong>Vue 3</strong> – I'd like to try it in a commercial product.<br />* <strong>GraphQL</strong> – I've met only REST interfaces in my commercial projects. It would be great to try something different ))",
